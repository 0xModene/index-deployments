# index-coop Deployments

This repository manages IndexCoop contract deployments using the [hardhat-deploy plugin][22].

Each deployment is tracked and recorded by network in a [deployments/outputs][23] file.

**All proposed deployments should:**
+ deploy to HardhatEVM
+ have unit tests which check the correctness of state variables set in the constructor
+ be deployed to Kovan and verified from the command line on `kovan.etherscan`

## Install
```
cp .env.default .env
yarn
```

## Launch test client
```
yarn chain
```

## Test (deployment)
```
yarn clean-dev-deployment
yarn deploy:local
```

## Test (unit)
```
yarn test
```

## Usage Guide

New deployments have two phases:

1. PR for a deployment script with tests
2. PR for an executed deployment

### 1: Deployment scripts

To add a new deployment script, create 3 files prefixed with the next deployment stage numeral.
```sh
# Example
touch deploy/015_my_deployment_script.ts
touch deployments/constants/015_my_deployment_script.ts
touch test/deploys/015_my_deployment_script.ts
```

Then find the **most recent** deployment scripts and tests which are similar to the deployment you'd like to execute and copy/paste them for use as templates.

**Pro Tip**: It's a good idea to deploy and verify new contracts on Kovan at this stage (in addition to locally) to catch any contract verification issues early in the process.

**Example deployment to Kovan:**

Fill in the following fields in your `.env` file:

+ `KOVAN_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY`: An automated kovan faucet is on [gitter, here][24], or [myCrypto, here][27]
+ `INFURA_TOKEN`: An Infura projectID. Available with an account at [infura.io][25]
+ `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Available with an account from [etherscan.io/api][26]

**Run:**
```
yarn deploy:kovan
yarn etherscan:kovan
```

(If etherscan fails, see Etherscan section below).


### 2: Executing Deployments

Checkout master and `git pull` the latest state. Then:
+ checkout a new branch to deploy on.
+ deploy/verify contracts on `staging_mainnet` and validate the contracts' read/write endpoints using Etherscan's contract UI.
+ deploy/verify contracts on `production`
+ commit and push the automated changes made to the `deployments/outputs/` logs to Github and open a PR
with a description documenting the addresses of the new components.

## Etherscan verification

Set `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=8UC6MJ3E5R2AXIHFZQ6JNU2U5QCV1EZGX5Y` in `.env`

After deploying, run the command for your network:
```
yarn etherscan:kovan
yarn etherscan:staging_mainnet
yarn etherscan:production
```

**When Etherscan fails...**

Verification may fail because of [solidity issue 9573][1] which causes Etherscan
to generate different bytecode from a minimized contract set than what was generated locally with
all contracts in the project. The error message says:

```
Compiling your contract excluding unrelated contracts did not produce identical bytecode.
Trying again with the full solc input used to compile and deploy it.
This means that unrelated contracts may be displayed on Etherscan...
NomicLabsHardhatPluginError: Source code exceeds max accepted (500k chars) length
```

To get around this, use the `compile:one` task to compile your target contract in isolation.

In a deployment script, right before the problematic contract is deployed:
```js
// Compile in isolation for Etherscan verification bug
await bre.run("set:compile:one", { contractName: "MerkleDistributor"});
```

Or at the command line:
```sh
# Example
yarn compile:one MerkleDistributor
yarn deploy:kovan
yarn etherscan:kovan
```

## Multisig Transaction Utilities

#### `yarn tx`

The `tx` yarn command lets you view transactions deferred for multi-sig execution and compare data
generated by the deployments scripts with data generated by the browser multisig wallets.

**Usage**
```
USAGE: yarn tx <command> [args]

 Commands:
  list:                    lists all deferred transactions by transaction number with description
  view <tx-num>:           shows detail for a deferred transaction
  compare <tx-num> <data>: checks that tx data at `tx-num` matches `data` (from wallet)

 Options:
  --file <descriptor>:     `deployments/outputs/*.json` file to query (defaults: `1-production`)
```

**Examples**

`yarn tx list`
```
Tx   Description
====  ===========
49    Add TradeModule to Controller
50    Add OneInchExchangeAdapter to IntegrationRegistry
55    Add WrapModule to Controller
...
```

`yarn tx view 73`
```

{
  "args": [
   "0x2579D2B186BbA16999016dB077b4874A7520f92e"
  ],
  "signature": "addModule(address)",
  "data": "0x1ed86f190000000000000000000000002579d2b186bba16999016db077b4874a7520f92e"
}
```

`yarn tx compare 73 0xc642747400000....`
```
> Add GovernanceModule to Controller
> ==================================
> OK (data matches)
```

### `yarn console`

Hardhat console exposes a `set` variable which gives you access to all contract methods and
dependency addresses. It can be used to compose transaction data for arbitrary methods
and inputs, as well as fetch recent multisig transactions from Etherscan. The interface is:

```ts
set.addresses: object
set.addressStartsWith(prefix: string)
set.methods(contractName: string)
set.data(methodName: string, args: string[])
await set.recent(maxRecords?: number)
```

**Usage**

`yarn console`
```
> set.addresses
